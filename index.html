          <h2>GEMbench: A comprehensive benchmark of omics data and integration methods for assessment of metabolic patterns in cancers</h2>
          <p>The cornerstone of metabolic research in oncology was laid by Otto Warburg in the 1920s when he discovered the main metabolic hallmark of cancer, aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) refers to a common feature of cancer cell metabolism in which cancer cells take up glucose at high rates accompanied by lactate secretion in the presence of oxygen. Since then, a large quantity of high-throughput data has unravelled other metabolic hallmarks of cancer which contribute to better cancer stratification and personalized treatment. Aided by metabolic modelling approaches, in particular, genome-scale metabolic modelling (GEM), studies in cancer cell metabolism have expanded our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer development, as well as identification of diagnostic biomarkers, potential drug targets, and prognosis biomarker. Using omics-data integration approaches, GEMs can be tailored to a specific context. These context-specific GEMs facilitate the unveiling of the genotype-phenotype relationship by calculating the flux states and extracting physiologically relevant information from high-quality data.</p>
          <p>Since 2002 to now, more than fifty methods have been developed to investigate how gene expression integration into GEMs could affect model content and predictive accuracy. These methods differ in assumptions and mathematical formulation, use different gene expression datasets (e.g. microarray data or RNA-sequencing data) and various GEMs of organisms from bacteria to human. These heterogeneous datasets and diverse algorithms are difficult to compare and to benchmark.</p>
          <p>Here, we performed a comprehensive benchmark to assess the influence of omics-data (regarding the data sources, types and platforms) and integration methods on the metabolic patterns in cancers. We collected different types of omics data (transcriptome and proteome) from different sources (cell-lines and patients), as well as different platforms (RNA-Seq and microarray) and integrated them into Recon3D (the generic GEM of Humans) by four integration algorithms (GIMME, iMAT, INIT, and FASTCORE).</p>

        <h2>Integration Methods</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      From 2002 to now, more than fifty methods have been developed to investigate how gene expression integration into GEM could affect model content and predictive accuracy.
      The first study, which tried to overcome this issue, was published in 2002 by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12006566">Covert and Palsson</a>.
      In 2004, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491858">Akesson et al.</a> used gene expression data as an additional constraint on the metabolic fluxes in yeast. Afterwards, different algorithms were devised for tackling this challenge <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18483554">GIMME</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19714220">E-Flux</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20823844">MBA</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19346491">Moxley</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172910">MADE</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013597">RELATCH</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615553">INIT</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23234303">mCADRE</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646661">tINIT</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26942765">CORDA</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27327084">E-Flux2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27327084">SPOT</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222750">FASTCORE</a>. These algorithms can be classified in many different ways on the basis of the underlying methodology.
</p>
      <p>
 In 2014, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762745">Machado and Herrgård</a> classified methods by three main criteria: 1. how do they apply the gene expression levels (discrete vs continuous, absolute vs relative), 2. Model functionality regarding flux prediction or 3. Model building. 
</p>
      <p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25379144">Kim and Lun</a> considered four grouping criteria, regarding gene expression and model functionality: 1. Algorithms which require multiple gene expression datasets as input, 2. Requirement for gene expression threshold to define a gene's high and low expression, 3. Requirement of an appropriate objective function for a given GEM, and 4. Validation of predicted fluxes directly against measured intracellular fluxes.
</p>
      <p>
In 2015, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158726">Estévez and Nikoloski</a> stratified the methods in three distinct groups:
 <ul>
   <li><strong>GIMME- and GIM<sup>3</sup>E-like methods.</strong> This group refers to the two-steps approaches with a metabolic functionality (<em>objective function</em>) being optimized through <abbr title="Flux Balance Analysis">FBA</abbr> in a first step. Then, the obtained optimal value is employed to minimize the discrepancies between fluxes and data.</li>
   <li><strong>iMAT-and INIT-like methods.</strong>  This group of algorithms determines the binary reaction status (i.e., active or inactive) which are in good agreement with the associate data state.</li>
   <li><strong>MBA-, mCADRE and FASTCORE-like methods.</strong>  This group defines a core set of active reactions and then finds the minimum essential set of reactions to satisfy the model consistency condition.</li>
   </ul>
</p>
      <p>

In this study we focus on the following integration methods:

<ul>
  <li><strong>FASTCORE</strong> takes a core set of active reactions in the context of interest as an input</li>
  <li><strong>GIMME</strong> minimizes the utilization of inactive reactions</li>
  <li><strong>INIT</strong> uses the relaxation strategy to prevent the removal of reactions that have a small net accumulation rate</li>
  <li><strong>iMAT</strong> assumes gene expression into two groups: highly and lowly expressed and then maximizes the consistency with this classification</li>
</ul>
